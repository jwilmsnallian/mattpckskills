description: Turn the current conversation into a PRD and publish it to the project issue tracker — no interview, just synthesis of what you've already discussed.

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a PRD. Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you — run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if not.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the PRD, and respect accepted ADRs in the area you're touching; treat proposed ADRs as planning context only when they belong to the current work. Skim any project coding-standards rules (`.claude/rules/`, including a symlinked shared rule set) so implementation/testing decisions in the PRD align with the project's conventions. If the feature has a decision ledger (`docs/decisions/`), read it — its records are the resolved answers this PRD must preserve verbatim, not soften. If the project keeps a `ROADMAP.md` (or a product/vision doc), read it so this PRD is grounded in the larger goal the slice advances.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the PRD using the template below. Before publishing, check coverage: every decision-ledger record must map to a user story, implementation decision, or testing decision, with its constraints preserved exactly — surface any record you couldn't place rather than dropping it. Then publish it to the project issue tracker. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label - no need for additional triage. If a `ROADMAP.md` tracks this work, move the slice you just specified to its `Now`/`Done` bucket and link this PRD, so the roadmap stays a live picture of what's left.

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this PRD.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
